WASD to move and left and right click to use active items.
Also we can try Shift + left or right click, Alt + click, Control + click. (I'm not sure if Macs have control.)
Then maybe 1, 2, 3, 4 for lesser used items.
It's hard to use other keyboard keys if we also use WASD, so shift, alt and control with a mouse click seem like good ways to use items.

Otherwise, we can go with all keyboard based gameplay.
