If you reach the end of the world, and you go past a certain point. There is a portal or something that you go into it, and you
exit the world(the world is over). You select one of your items from your inventory, and that item is available in your
inventory when you start. If you beat the game multiple times, you have a lot of diffeerent items to start out with. 

Idea: Inventory is completely greyed out, you can choose any of the items that are greyed out that you don't already have

Idea: Caves, it could be in some place, where there are alot of difficult enemies 

Idea: Circle issue, the circle may be to big, Square system?
