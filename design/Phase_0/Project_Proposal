Project description : We decided to make a turn-based roguelike game. The game will be 2D while the player looks from a bird's eye view.  The player needs to fight enemies of varying difficulty, and aspects of the game will be randomized with every new game so that the player will have different experiences. The goal of the project/game is for the entertainment of the players.

Note: As we develop the game, we may change the title.
