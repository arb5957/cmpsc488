PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Consilium Path is a 2D rougelike game where the player plays from a top-down birds-eye view perspective. The player
begins with a single item and from there builds their own adventure towards the eventual goal of beating the game. Hordes of unique and
interesting monsters spawn and the player must use the items obtained to defeat these monsters. The unique aspect of enemies is that
they are allowed to use the same equipment as the player. Each enemy has its own inventory and depending on the difficulty, this leads
to a plethora of different gameplay each time. For the player to win, they must travel across the harsh monster infected land and 
eventually reach the end point of the world to face the final boss. Upon successful completion, the player is allowed to keep one item
from their inventory obtained in their run through and use it for the next play through. A fun, challenging game, where a bit of skill 
and good decision making is needed to obtain the honor and glory of beating Consilium Path. 
SPONSORS: None.
